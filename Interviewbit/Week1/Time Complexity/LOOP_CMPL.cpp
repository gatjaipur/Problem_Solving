   int a = 0, b = 0;    
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            a = a + rand();  
        }
        for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            b = b + rand();
        }


        // What is the time, space complexity of following code : Assume that rand() is O(1) time, O(1) space function.

// Ans. O(N + M) time, O(1) space
